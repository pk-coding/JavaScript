<h1>Goals when creating the game:</h1>
<ul>
<li>The first goal was to use only HTML, CSS and JavaScript - without any additional tools.</li>
<li>The second goal was to write JavaScript code that operated solely based on interoperability functions - without classes.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Use:</h1>
<ul>
<li>All you need to do is download the index.html, index.js and style.css files into one directory and then open the index.html file in your browser.</li>
<li>There is no responsiveness implemented, so you should open the screen at least 14 inches.</li>
The results are saved in local storage.
